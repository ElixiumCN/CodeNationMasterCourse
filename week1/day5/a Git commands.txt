open in integrated terminal automatic CD change dir to the right place
Initizaliting a new Git repo via Terminal

- Create a repo on the website
- copy these commands from the website
- paste these commands in the terminal

echo "# somethingNew" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit" // -m = message for the commit
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/ElixiumCN/somethingNew.git
git push -u origin main // upload to the website

git push


seems like if a git repo already exists... the git terminal knows about it and all you have to do is change directory into it and then push without manually specifying the repo
and if I change folder into a folder that belongs to a different repo
and then push.. it will push to the correct repo automatically without having to specify the repo

git add . // will add all files and subfolders to the repo/tracking
